# Tic Tac Toe

The example of the  [Presentation pattern](https://github.com/StanKocken/Presentation/) into my talk at the DroidCon Paris 2015.

## What's inside

A basic game Tic Tac Toe with the Board and a basic Artificial Intelligence.

This project show how I use the Presentation pattern, using my library, for a game like that.

This project is fully tested, except the OriginalActivity (just an example of the same implementation into a single Activity).
